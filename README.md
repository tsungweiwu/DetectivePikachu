# Detective Pikachu Discord Bot

### Designed to
- Have a reminder for the user to know when they are able to catch another pokemon
  - The pokemon bot has a 'cool-down' on how often someone can catch a pokemon
  - This allows the users to have the most optimal catching experience and time without having to run into cool down warnings
  
- This also retrieves the embedded message for '**Shiny**' and '**Legendary**' Pokemons that are caught
  - To showcase to other server members of their achievements there is a detection system that captures these events
